# Sum of Squares

### Assignment:
Update file sum_sq.c to:
1. Accept two integers, eg: x=2, y=3
2. Compute the square of integers using math.h library functions: x^2 , y^2
3. Print the sum of the squares of the integers: x^2 + y^2

### Steps to submit changes:
1. Click on sum_sq.c to open file.
2. Click on the pencil icon to edit file on the top right.
3. Update the file with code following assignment instructions.
4. Once you are ready to submit your changes, click on the green "Commit changes..." button on the top right.
5. Enter a commit message that describes your changes in a few words - eg: added printf statement.
6. Select "Commit directly to the main branch".
7. Click on "Commit Changes" button. Your code changes have been submitted!

### To check whether your code changes passed:
1. Click on "Actions" on the top.
2. Click on the latest workflow from the list.
3. Click on "Autograding" - you'll see a green check mark or red cross depending on whether your code has successfully passed or not.
4. If your code did not pass, you can expand the desired section and see the error message.



### Note:
We strongly recommend you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly. You should always test on your laptop first, and then copy the finished code to github. Test your program on your machine using the instructions you received in the lab sessions.

If your code did not pass, revise your code and submit(commit) your changes again.

Make sure you have your final submission in before the deadline has passed.

You will not be able to submit changes after the deadline has passed.

For any questions, please reach out to Dr. Katy Tarrit (katytm7@hawaii.edu) AND Aditi Jaiswal (ajaiswal@hawaii.edu)
